Old System: Sorting Favorite Numbers 

Everybody picks their favorite number 1-99
They all go up to the board and write it down in a line
They then have to sort the numbers, the last person up there then writing them


New System: Easy Sort (Create a stem and leaf plot eventually)

Phased Conversion: Have people go up by what their numbers start with
Write in a stem and leaf plot fashion
get like (10, 15, 12, 28, 23, 25, 39, 32, 35 etc)
Sort numbers after (10, 12, 15, 23, 25, 28, 32, 35, 39)

Then have people go up by the sum of their digits

1 goes up first
Then 2, then 3 and so on, up to 18

get like 
1 
10 
----
1 2
11
20
----
1 2 3 
11 12
21
30

Parallel Conversion: On one half the board do the old way, the other half do the new way
have to people write the sorted numbers top to down, see what is faster
